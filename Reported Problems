Version 1.17:

$ python scanShellSpace.py -D /home/ender/ -t php

!!! The command does not work because the "ender" directory is too large and it contains too many sub-directories, thus the program
cannot list all .php files

Solution: - Scan without having file type:  $ python scanShellSpace.py -D /home/ender/

          - Do not give a large directory if you want to scan with file type.
